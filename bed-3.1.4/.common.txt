Press bed to start the program.

If you are running bed in gnome-terminal you should disable gnome-terminal
catching your keystrokes by Edit->Keyboard shortcuts-> Disable all menu access
keys.

Sometimes problems with the screen or keys are solved by copying another
terminfo file to /usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm or setting TERM to another value.
For example, in my variant of Redhat 7.1 and ncurses-5.2, Konsole 1.0.1 gives 
a messed up screen when paging with 
TERM=xterm bed /dev/hda
gnome-terminal 1.2.4 makes paint errors with TERM=xterm
both are solved by using TERM=rxvt
For if you don't have this terminfo file, you can copy it from
CONFDIRLINK/r/rxvt to TERMINFO/r/rxvt. (TERMINFO is you terminfo dir,
something like /usr/share/terminfo).

If the coloring is terrible you can try black and white only with 
"bed -B".  If this is o.k. you can try to edit ~/.bedrc (copy from bedrc) 
to change the color names. 

If you use a different configuration from me, some keys possibly don't work.

If you Alt-key combinations don't work, there is probably some misconfiguration
of you operating system, Xwindows or the xterminal you are using. Try other 
terminal programs and system environments to find out were the problem is 
located and read its manual or ask someone in the IRC how to change it. 
In my Debian 2.2R6 installation in xterm and rxvt the alt keys don't work. 
But after the following commands the Alt keys worked in newly created rxvt's 
but not in xterm's:
	xmodmap -e "keycode 115 = 0x6a1"
	xmodmap -e "keycode 116 = 0x6a2"
	xmodmap -e "keycode 117 = 0x6a3"
	xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
after adding
	xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Alt_L"
the Alt keys also worked in newly created xterm's. 
Yes Linux isn't as popular as MS windows because of it's difficult user 
interface.

The following only applies to function keys other then Alt or Control 
combinations. 

If you use Linux console and you are using a diffent keyboard translation
table then me, you can use ./bedkeys instead of bed.
It saves the current translation table, loads my keyboard table and
after termination of bed reloads the old table again (this 
keyboard table is shared by all virtual consoles). 

You can also modify how bed interprets keys (see man bed). 
With Alt-t,k you can view the current keybinding and how to describe
a key combination.

The missing keybinding of bed as mentioned in it's menu can be set by pressing:

     bed -k

If keys are disabled by the keyboard translation tables this will not work. 
It will also not work if you keyboard translation tables have 
codes bound to a different key. In that case you can possibly remove
the old key defintions out of ~/.bedrc.

The new key bindings will be applied if the TERM variable has the same
value as now. If you want to make it dependent on an other variable
place it below a different "context var val" statement (see man 1 bed).

If something is unclear or wrong send me an email.
