bed - adjustable data format binary editor

In Program Files\bed\ is the following documentation:
  README          - Install information
  bed.html        - Manual
  misc/README.txt - Information about saved composed data types

The main program is windows\bed.exe

Put cygwin1.dll in windows, windows\system, windows\system32, in the 
directory in which bed.exe resides or another directory in your PATH. 
Using the wrong cygwin1.dll version can give problems. Only one 
cygwin1.dll can be in use on your computer at the same time.

bed -h shows which cygwin1.dll bed is using.
