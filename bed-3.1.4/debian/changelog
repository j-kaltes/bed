  * Tracing calling of functions for debugging (because gdb version 4.16 support of c++ is 
  * 	restricted, no stack when failing in delete )
  * Solved mysterous segmentation violation
  * Longer filenames possible in listfiles
  * previously the program could only run with libncurses1.9.9e, now also with libncurses1.9.9g
  * 	and libncurses.4.2
  * can't open /proc/locks anymore (only known file which creates problems)
  * explicit long limit on filesize, because of problems with /dev/dev1_8

  * 
  * In search and replace 
  * 	- conversion between formats was no good when the number contained zero.
  * 	- now padding with zero's on the left when not enough characters
  * added menus to alt-f,p
  * Added the possibility to see keybinding (Alt-f,k)
  * By some unknown reason, when ascii took the full screen, linedown gave strange
  * results. Solved with an extra refresh when ENDOFLINEBUF is defined. When this
  * buf, in probably ncurses is solved, this should not be defined.

  * 
  * getselbuf was wrong
  * Bug in regex compile (searchexpr was not set properly to zero before compile). This
  * 	resulted in a segmentation violation when using groupings.
  * Jump over replaced part in regex replace;
  * Processking of key bindings changed so that keys that overwrite a shorter or longer definition will not get into 
  * trouble.
  * Alt-F in open now not changed by other operations
  *
