The devices shown are taken out of /proc/partitions. Subvolumes of LVM 
partitions are not included. To edit them start bed with something like

 bed /dev/mapper/* 

Before editing any hard disk device decide with which permissions and under 
what user and group you want to do that. Before changing anything in a real
hard drive, try you changes first on a test file or better a test USB-stick.
