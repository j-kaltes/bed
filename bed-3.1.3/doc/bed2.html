<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


<P>
Adjustable data format binary editor. Data formats are
ASCII, unsigned and signed integers, float, bit-flags,
bit-fields, labels, ebcdic and time_t. Different sizes
and byte orderings are possible. Data types can
be used in structures. Other data formats, filters and
procedures can be defined in plugins. Contains copy,
past, undo, redo, search, replace, marks, record/play and
context sensitive help. Raw edit of hard drives. Under  
Linux and FreeBSD even usable without X windows.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Interface</H3>

Some general remarks about working with bed.
In bed you can do everything with the menu. You open a menu by pressing Alt in combination
with the highlighted key. A menu item is selected by pressing only the highlighted key or
using movement keys followed by Enter. You can get help about a menu item by pressing F1.
You escape from the menu by pressing Esc.
In dialog boxes you can jump to the highlighted character by pressing Alt-char or
by using Tab and Alt-tab or shift-tab. Options are switched on by pressing space or *.
Buttons like Ok and Cancel are operated by moving to the button and pressing Enter.
<P>

While editing the usual movement keys should work, if they don't run bed -k.
<P>

Select works wp5.1 (and vi) like: You specify a starting point (Alt-e,s)
and with whatever moving function exist you go to an other
point and you then press copy (Alt-e,c) or save selection (Alt-e,a).
<P>

bed has only a type-over mode, so your data doesn't move to another offset without
explicitly saying so. To extend a file you should explicitly call Alt-e,x. If you like to leave something out you should copy everything after it, past it
over what you like to remove and truncate the file with Alt-e,t.
<P>

To be able to handle large files (e.g. whole hard drives) bed only holds in memory what 
is  changed and reads the other parts from disk at the moments they are needed. 
<P>

If bed seems to get into a time consuming operation, you can try Ctrl-C (Ctrl-Break when using win95 with pdcurses). It should bring bed back to it's main loop, but  sometimes problems arise.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Data types</H3>

In bed you can display the file content in different dataformats for example: ASCII, signed and unsigned integers of variable base and size, and Floating point number of size 4 (float),8(double) and 12 (long double). 
Beside this standard types there are lots of other data types like:  bitflags, bitfields, translate (enum), ebcdic etc. You can also also add new data types in plugins.
<P>

<B>composed data type</B>
<BR>

It is also possible to form composed data types (structures, records).
At different offset within a unit the file content is displays in a different
data type. 
<PRE>
struct nameincome {
        char name[20];
        unsigned long income;
        };
</PRE>

For example if the file contains a database of strings of size 20 followed by a digit of 4 bytes, you can make a composed data type of ASCII/20 and Dec/4. You do this simple by first making a ascii of size 20 by pressing Alt-d,a and filling in 20 for Nr Bytes and setting Separate and then adding a unsigned integer by pressing Alt-t,d,makemode setting for Nr bytes 4 and check Dec and Add field.
<P>

All kind of operations which can be applied to basic (single) data types can also be applied on composed data types: search, replace and the addition of a filter (e.g reorder). To do this you need to make the composed data type the active data type. You can do this by setting the cursor between two of its elements or by using Alt-y,t.
<P>

<B>Switching data type</B>
<BR>

Moving between parts of the screen with different data types
you can do with Prev (Alt-d,v) and Next (Alt-d,n). 
<BR>

Zooming a data type you do with Full (Alt-d,f), removing a
data type with Remove (Alt-d,r).
<BR>

Save selection saves the selected part of the file in the
format of the active data type. 
<BR>

<B>Adding data types</B>
<BR>

You can add a data type with ASCII, Integer, Signed, Float, Clone.
Clone gives an identical copy of the currently active
data type.
<BR>

Integer (alt-d,i) gives the following window:
<PRE>
                                          
   (*) Hex   ( ) Dec   ( ) Custom:        
   ( ) Oct   ( ) Bin   Base nr:           
                                          
   Nr bytes:   1                          
                          (*) Add field   
     Ok        Cancel     ( ) Separate    
                                          
</PRE>

<BR>

You can specify the base of the integer in the field Base nr
or you can use one of the options Hex,Oct,Dec or Bin. Hex
stands for hexadecimal, Oct for octal, Dec for decimal and bin
for binary. You can also check Custom and specify a base number.
<BR>

You can specify the number of bytes and the order in which the
bytes are interpreted.
<BR>

You can set Add field or Separate.
Separate makes a separate data type. Add field means that this data type is added to the currently active data type, making a composed data type (struct, record).  In the last case where in the existing data type the new field is placed depends on the cursor position:
<BR>

- At the end of the existing data type if the cursor is at the end of the screen
<BR>

- At the beginning of the existing data type if the cursor is at the beginning of the screen
<BR>

- Otherwise at the place closest to the cursor.
<BR>

- After the cursor position if the distances are equal
<BR>

<B>Modifying data types</B>: 
<BR>

Basic data types you can change by pressing Alt-y,g (Config).
This are operation you can apply on some data types which
changes certain aspects while leaving other aspects the same. 
It are usually the same options you had when creating a data type.
<BR>

<B>Filters</B>: 
<BR>

It is possible to place filters between the file and a data type. Such a filter can transform the file content before interpretating it as a certain kind of data type.
Currently there are the following filters:
<BR>

<BR>

Reorder (Alt-y,o)
<BR>

Duplicate (Alt-y,i)
<BR>

Skip (Alt-y,k)
<BR>

Backward (Alt-t,d,backward)
<BR>

Index2table (Alt-t,d,index2table)
<BR>

Translate (Alt-d,l)
<BR>

You can find a description by pressing F1 in the menu with the appropriate menu item
selected. The same description you can find somewhat further in this file in the list of all procedures. You can remove the last added filter by pressing Alt-y,m (Rm filter).
<BR>

When using some filters, filters, like Skip, Index2table and and possibly Backward, differences in
file content are not always shown on the screen. Skip for example skips some bytes. Normal search translates the search string in a string of bytes and then
searches for this string in the raw content of the file. This is obviously
not possible if skipped bytes can contain different data within the file.
Regex search uses a different method. It first transformes the file content
to the search data type and then searches in this data type for the search string.
So if you use this kind if filters you should check regex search. The same applies for other data type were what is displayed can corresponced to different bytes
like Float and Empty.
<P>

<B>Saving data types</B>: 
<BR>

Press Alt-y,w (Write Type) to save a data type. You can read it again with Alt-y,d (Read Type). /usr/local/share/bed/misc contains some example
saved data types. Read /usr/local/share/bed/misc/README.txt for a description.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Search</H3>

When you press on search of the Move menu (Alt-m,s), you come in the
search window. Standard you search in the currently active
data type. To select a different data type you press on space
when the appropriate data type is selected (like ASCII). 
<BR>

When you instead presses on Return the search string is also
converted from the old data type to the new data type. 
<BR>

Beside this there are also the usual features like starting
from the top or the bottom of the file instead of the cursor
position, searching backwards, searching case insensitive and
using regular expressions. 
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

<B>Regular expression</B>:  Use the GNU regular expression library to
match a pattern against the text (See 
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+regex">regex</A>(7)</B>

). When using regular expression you can search forward and backward in
ascii text. In any other data type you can only search
forward. When &quot;Regular expression&quot; is not checked everything
is first converted to a general byte string and then for this
byte string is searched in the file. When searching  with
regular expressions enabled the file is block for block
converted to the currently active data type and this printable
representation is searched for regular expressions in exactly
the same way as when the file was originally in this form.
This means for example that when searching case sensitively
the hex data type ff is different from FF.
<BR>

When using  a floating point plugin different byte
strings can give the same superficial appearance. When you
convert the search pattern first into bytes and then search
for the bytes, you will only find one of this underlying byte
strings. When searching in regex mode you will find all of
them. The char2 plugin contains a data type which leaves out
every other byte. And when converting to bytes you have to
fill them in with something and when in the file they are
filled different you will not find the byte string. But when
searching only in the superficial appearance you can find
them.
<BR>

I haven't tried any attempt to optimize regular
expressions so regular expression search in ascii is very
slow, and this conversion to other data types before searching
makes it even slower. So only small distances can be searched
this way.
<BR>

Further shortcoming of regular expressions search:
<BR>

- Only one hit in a single data type is returned. When
searching for 1 in a hex data type it stops only once in 11.
<BR>

- The same byte can generate a hit in different alignments.
Only one is shown. To see them all you should change the
alignment around every hit.
<P>

<B>Case sensitive</B>: When checked upper and lower case are
treated distinctively
<BR>

<B>Boundaries</B>: Multibyte data types can be aligned differently a 4
byte digit can start at offset 0,1,2 or 3 and give then
different 4 byte digits. Without checking Boundaries all will
be returned. With Boundaries checked only bytes aligned in the
same way as is now shown on the screen are returned.
<BR>

<B>Forward</B>: When checked the file is searched in the forward
direction going from lower to higher offsets.  When not checked the file is searched backward.
<BR>

<B>Edge file</B>: When checked the file is searched from the edge of
the file. From offset 0 when searching forward, from end of
file when searching backward.
<BR>

<B>Find</B>: Here you type the search pattern
<BR>

<B>List</B>: Generated a list of all hits. If compiled with
CONFIG_THREADS=y, you can go on editing while hits are marked
so you can view them in marklist (Alt-k,l).
<BR>

<B>ASCII</B>, <B>Dec</B> etc give when checked the current active data type.
The last data type is the currently active. In this case that it char2. Which is a plugin data type.
<BR>

<B>Nr bytes</B>: give the number of bytes each data item occupies. By
some data type you can change this for example by unsigned integers. 
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Replace</H3>

Everything has the same meaning as in search, with a replace
string added.
<BR>

At the place where the search string is found the replacestring is placed. The replace string
<BR>

overwrites the data. When Regular expression is checked you
can insert the whole search string by &amp; or
<BR>

subexpressions by \1 \2 to \9. In the searchstring
subexpressions are demarcated by \(pattern\).
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Tools</H3>

A few options not handles by other menus.
<BR>

<B>Numbertype</B>: changing the number type in which the offset in
the file is shown (or removing offset numbers).
<BR>

<B>Messageline</B>: switching the messageline on and off, 
<BR>

<B>Menu</B>: switching the menu bar on and off
<BR>

<B>Commandmode</B>:  setting commandmode on and off. Inside command
mode the normal keys are not automatically put into the
document. This makes it possible to bound commands to normal
keys, like is done inside vi. By default there are no
key bindings of this kind, but you can put it into the
configuration file if you want. 
<BR>

<B>Procedures</B>: View list off all procedures which can be bounded
to keys or are part of the menu. Press return on a procedure
to execute the procedure.
<BR>

<B>Dynamic</B>: view procedures defined in plugins
<BR>

<B>Load plugin</B>: file manager to select a plugin
<BR>

<B>Key binding</B>: shows the procedure bounded to a particular key

<H2>TERMINALS</H2>

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Linux</H3>

<BR>

Bed is a terminal program. So you can
use it with an X windows terminal emulator like
<B>rxvt</B>

or
<B>xterm</B>

or with
<B>Linux console</B>
without using X windows.
In the newer Linux distributions you should add rxvt yourself. Add
<PRE>
XTerm*metaSendsEscape:  true
XTerm*altSendsEscape:   true
</PRE>

to ~/.Xdefaults or /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm to use bed in xterm. 
Changes take effect after the next restart of X windows or after running 
xrdb filename.
<BR>

<B>gnome-terminal</B>

becomes usable after the following changes:
<BR>

If
<PRE>

        set|grep TERM

</PRE>

returns TERM=xterm, you probably get a
messed up screen.
<PRE>

        export TERM=rxvt

</PRE>

will solve the problem (if you have the
right bedrc file, this is already done for you).
<P>

In the 
<PRE>

Edit-&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts

</PRE>

menu of  gnome-terminal you switch off 
<PRE>

        [ ] Enable menu access keys

</PRE>

and
<PRE>

        [ ] Enable menu shortcut key

</PRE>

Also change the following Shortcut keys:
<PRE>

Help
        Contents        Ctrl+Alt+H

</PRE>

(instead of F1)
<PRE>

View
        Full Screen     Ctrl+Alt+F 

</PRE>

(instead of F11)
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>FreeBSD</H3>

With the keymap of my FreeBSD installation Alt-key combinations didn't work properly in 
virtual consoles. In /usr/local/share/bed/README.FreeBSD I explain how to solve that.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>MS Windows</H3>

Bed has two MS Windows versions. The <B>pdcurses</B> version runs only under MS Windows 
consoles like <B>cmd</B>, <B>command</B> and <B>powershell</B>. The <B>ncurses</B> version 
also runs within cygwin's rxvt and xterm. Within xterm, koi8rxterm and uxterm you should check 
&quot;Main Options-&gt;Meta Sends Escape&quot; to use Alt-key combinations. To make it permanent
add the following to ~/.Xdefaults or KOI8RXTerm, UXTerm, XTerm and XTerm-color in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults
<PRE>
XTerm*metaSendsEscape:  true
XTerm*altSendsEscape:   true
UXTerm*metaSendsEscape: true
UXTerm*altSendsEscape:  true
KOI8RXTerm*metaSendsEscape:     true
KOI8RXTerm*altSendsEscape:      true
</PRE>

For the ncurses version you need to download ncurses libraries from <A HREF="http://cygwin.com">http://cygwin.com</A>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

In the configuration file you can change colors, assign keys, change
the menulayout, loud plugins. and configure to call procedure's at certain moments.
As configuration file is used the first file found of following:
the argument to -f at the command line ,
the environmental variable BEDRC, ~/.bedrc or /usr/local/share/bed/bedrc.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Commandline Options</H3>

<PRE>
<B>options</B> options
</PRE>

After the keyword <B>options</B> options are given in exactly the same way as after
bed in the command line. These options are processed after the commandline options and in
the order they are given in the configuration file (when multiple <B>options</B> keywords
are specified). For example if you add
<PRE>
options -C
</PRE>

to the /usr/local/share/bed/bedrc (and that is the only configuration file) -B on the command line loses
its effect.
<BR>

With
<BR>

<PRE>
options -w
</PRE>

you can for example make bed always experimentally determine the sizes of hard drives and DVD's instead of relying on the sizes returned by system calls end the like.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Path</H3>

<B>plugindir</B> path
<BR>

Sets plugindir to path. This makes bed search for plugins in path. It also affects
Alt-t,l.
<BR>

<B>datatypedir</B> path
<BR>

Saved datatypes will be looked for in path. Affects Alt-y,w and Alt-y,d.
<BR>

<B>macrodir</B> path
<BR>

Save recorded (Alt-t,s) en Play File (Alt-t,y) will open
the filemanager in path.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Keys</H3>

When the keys don't work or you want to make different key bindings, you can assign 
<BR>&nbsp;new&nbsp;key&nbsp;bindings&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;file.&nbsp;
<BR>

In bedrc the keys are defined by lines of the following format:
<BR>

<BR>

<B></B>keys key1 key2 ...keyn = procedure
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

for example:
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

keys 27 115 = search
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

In which case Alt-s is bound to 'search' which is the search function.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

The numbers are a decimal representation of the escape sequences generated by a
key or a key combination. Within bed you can press Alt-t,k to press
a key and see the keycodes and keybinding.
<P>
Bed version 0.2.7 added the possibility to make keys statements of the
following format:
<BR>

<BR>

<B></B>keys capname  = procedure
<BR>

<BR>

capname is a terminfo name for a key sequence. For example
<BR>

<BR>

<B></B>keys kf1  = selectprocedure 
<BR>

<BR>

binds selectprocedure to function key F1. See man <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+terminfo">terminfo</A>(5) for details.
There seems to be as much variation in keylabels as keycodes, 
so don't expect to much.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

<B>bed -k
<BR>

</B>If you only want to assign the right meaning to the keys used
by the program
(instead of making new keybinding), you can press bed -k. You are
asked to press function
keys and it will append the corresponding key assignments to
~/.bedrc.
<BR>

<B>Personal keybindings
<BR>

</B>If you want to make personal keybindings you should come to
know the
procedure argument to keys. To come to know the name of a
procedure mentioned
in the menu or bounded to an other key you press Alt-t,k followed
by the
key or menukey combination.
<BR>

If you want for example to know what the name is of the
procedure behind
Alt-f,o you press Alt-t,k followed by Alt-f,o and on the
command line
you see something like &quot;menu item Alt-f,o = addfile&quot;.
To bind this to insert you press Alt-t,k ,INS and get as answer
something like:
No keybinding for 27 91 50 126
You add now at the bottum of ~/.bedrc 
<BR>

keys 27 91 50 126 = addfile
<BR>

An other way to learn the names of the procedures is the read the
Procedures section later in this manual, but the program itself is
always  
more up to date then the manual.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Menu</H3>

New in bed-0.2.12 is the possibility to change the menu layout. 
You can add new items to the menu, add new menus and delete
menu items and menu's. A 'menu' corresponds to the list of names you get 
when you press for example Alt-f, (the menu with menulabel &quot;~File&quot;). 
A 'menuitem' corresponds on name in this list for example &quot;~Open     C-o&quot;.
<BR>

The menu's are numbered. The first menu on the left usually
&quot;~File&quot; has number 0, the following menu &quot;~Edit&quot; number 1 etc.
This number I will call 'menunum' in this manual.
<P>

<B>menu</B> [menunum] menulabel [+]
<BR>

This command is used to give a menu a certain label and
keybinding. 
One character in label should be prefixed by ~ meaning that is the
highlighted letter what should be pressed in combination with Alt
to open the menu. The menu label should be surrounded by  &quot;'-s.
e.g.
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;menu&nbsp;0&nbsp;&quot;My&nbsp;F~ile&quot;
<BR>

Changes the label of the &quot;~File&quot; menu to &quot;My ~File&quot;.
To insert a new empty menu at position 0 shifting the other menu's to the right, you
should add a + after the previous command, getting:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;menu&nbsp;0&nbsp;&quot;My&nbsp;F~ile&quot;&nbsp;+
<BR>

To create an empty menu at the very right you can use:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;menu&nbsp;8&nbsp;&quot;~Hallo&quot;
<BR>

In this case you can also leave out 8, 
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;menu&nbsp;&quot;~Hallo&quot;
<BR>

In the menu command menunum defaults to the highest used menu number+1.
<P>

<B>menuitem</B> [menunum] menuitemlabel [keylabel] [menitemnum] [+]= procedure
<BR>

This command is used to add menu items to menu's.
For example:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>menuitem 0 &quot;~Quit&quot; 1 = quit<BR>
<P>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>menuitem menunum menuitemlabel menuitemnum<BR>
<BR>

Replaces the existing menu item at position 1 in menu 0 with the label &quot;~Quit&quot; and the
procedure quit.
Menuitem's are numbered from 0 starting from above.
If you like to insert the menu item, while shifting the existing menu items downwards,
you can add a +, which gives:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>menuitem 0 &quot;~Quit&quot; 1 + = quit<BR>
<BR>

If you like to add a keylabel (e.g. M-q) you can change it to
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>menuitem 0 &quot;~Quit&quot; &quot;M-q&quot; 1 + = quit<BR>
<BR>

this will be displaced as something like &quot; <B>Q</B>uit     M-q &quot;
to make M-q work you should also add something like:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>keys 27 113 =quit<BR>
<BR>

In menu item menunum defaults to the last mentioned menu. menuitemnum defaults
to the highest menu item number + 1 (in this menu).
You can write:
<PRE>
     menu &quot;S~imple&quot;
     menuitem &quot;~New&quot; = emptyfile

     menuitem &quot;~Quit&quot; = quit
</PRE>

<P>

<B>menuitem</B> [menunum] LINE [menitemnum] [+]
<BR>

This command is used to create a blank like in a menu (leaving a menu item empty).
<BR>

To insert a line after &quot;~Open&quot; in the previous menu you can write:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;menuitem&nbsp;LINE&nbsp;2&nbsp;+
<P>

<B>deletemenu</B> [menunum]
<BR>

This command is used to delete a menu and all it's menu items. If you dislikes the first
menu (&quot;~File&quot;) you simply writes:
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deletemenu&nbsp;0
<BR>

In deletemenu menunum defaults to the highest numbered menu.
<P>

<B>deletemenuitem</B> [menunum] [menitemnum]
<BR>

Deletes menu item menuitemnum from menu menunum. menunum defaults to the last
mentioned menu, menuitemnum to the highest numbered menu item.
When only one number is given it is interpret as meaning menuitemnum (for
menunum the default is used).
To delete the fourth menu item out of the first menu, you write:
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>deletemenuitem 0 3<BR>
<BR>

In all menu commands you can explicitly use the default value by using a negative
number.
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Call_on</H3>

Instead of calling a procedure after pressing a key or using a menu, you can also
specify in the configuration file that procedure will be called at certain moment (on
startup,open,switch).
<BR>

<B>call_on_start</B> procedure
<BR>

Calls procedure at startup, which means after the program is has started, and a file is opened. Operated is on this file. 
<BR>

<B>call_on_open</B> procedure
<BR>

Procedure is called every time a file is opened.
<BR>

<B>call_on_switch</B> procedure
<BR>

Procedure is called every time you switch to a file.
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Context</H3>

When you use more than one terminal (for example linux console and rxvt), you can set a environmental variable to differentiate between the type of terminal
and use the context key word in ~/.bedrc.
<BR>

Everything started with the context keyword until the following context keyword or
end of file is only used when the right environmental variable set.
<BR>

The format of context is the following.
<BR>

<BR>

context [!] variablename [variablevalue]
<BR>

<BR>

For example:
<BR>

<BR>

context term xterm
<BR>

<BR>

You can also say
<BR>

<BR>

context variablename
<BR>

<BR>

when it should apply for all cases in which the variablename has a definition.
<BR>

For example
<BR>

<BR>

context termcap
<BR>

<BR>

applies in all cases in which termcap is defined.
<BR>

If you like to apply the next configuration only when an enviromental variable
is not set or has a different value, you have to write ! before the
enviromental variable.
<BR>

context ! DISPLAY
<BR>

means to apply the statements following this context statement and before
the next context statement only when DISPLAY is not set.
<BR>

If there is no environmental variable shared by the context you like to give
the same configuration you can set a environmental variable and use this at a context argument. It is possible to set enviromental variables within the configuration file with:
<BR>

<B>setenv</B> name val
<BR>

To do the same by TERM=cons25 as with TERM=cons50 you can write:
<PRE>
        context TERM cons25
        setenv consoleterm yes
        context TERM cons50
        setenv consoleterm yes
        context TERM cons43
        setenv consoleterm yes
        context consoleterm
        keys  27 91 97 = beginfile #S-F3
        keys  27 91 98 = endfile #S-F4
        keys  27 91 101 = middlepage #S-F7      
</PRE>

In combination with '!' you can this way create every possible boolean logic
formula (using the statement that every propositional logical formula can
be written with only not and or).
With setenv you have an or and '!' adds the not.
To apply statementZ only if X and Y you use &quot;X and Y&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;not (not X or not Y)&quot;
transforming this to bedrc you get
<PRE>
context ! X
setenv dont 1
context ! Y
setenv dont 1
context ! dont 1
statementZ
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Color</H3>

Colors can also be changed in the configuration file. There are around 17 screen
elements which you can give a foreground and background color and a list of
attributes (standout, underline, etc).
<BR>

The format is:
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

color screen-element [foreground background] [attr,attr...]
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

You can give only attributes or both the foreground and the background color and
any number of attributes.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

The screen parts are the following:
<BR>

TEXT: The color the text is showed in. It is better not to give this a color because this
makes the screen updating much slower (some feature of ncurses)
<BR>

COMMAND: the command line
<BR>

SELECTION: selection
<BR>

CURSOR: cursor in active datatype
<BR>

CURSORPAS: cursor in passive datatype
<BR>

SELCURSOR: cursor during selection
<BR>

BAR: the menubar
<BR>

BARKEY: Key highlighting in the menubar
<BR>

MENU: Opened menu's
<BR>

MENUKEY: key highlighting in menu
<BR>

MENUSEL: color of menu element which is selected
<BR>

OPENTITLE: title of file manager
<BR>

OPENKEY: key highlighting of key manager
<BR>

OPENNORMAL: background key manager
<BR>

OPENLIST: color of non active items of list
<BR>

OPENLISTSEL: color of active item
<BR>

OPENLISTACT: color of active item when this piece is used
<BR>

SHOWBACK: Search/replace window
<BR>

SPACEAFTER: color of space before and between datatypes
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

The colors and attributes are just the colors and attributes of ncurses. When they
don't look the way the name suggests you should send your complains to the makers
of ncurses.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

Colors: BLACK RED GREEN YELLOW BLUE MAGENTA CYAN WHITE
<BR>

Attributes: NORMAL STANDOUT UNDERLINE REVERSE BLINK DIM BOLD
PROTECT INVIS ALTCHARSET CHARTEXT
<P>
<BR>

For me only STANDOUT UNDERLINE REVERSE BLINK BOLD have a useful
meaning.
<BR>

On example:
<P>
<BR>

color BAR WHITE RED blink
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

Which makes a blinking white on red menu bar (on my computer it blinks only
under linux console and not in xterm or rxvt).
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

To make the cursor bold and underlined you can do
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

color cursor bold underline
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

The color lines can be intermixed with the keys lines and can also be specific to a
context.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

<H3>Procedures</H3>

When you want to make you own key bindings you need to know the names of
the procedures you can bind to keys. A selected subset of the procedures can also be assigned by using the name of the key they are normally bound to. There are the following key labels: 
<I>home</I>

, end, f1, up, down, left, right, pgup, pgdn, stab, delete, backspace and esc. When you assign a key sequence to a key label the meaning in the filemanager, search window  and menu is also changed.
so 
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>keys 1 = home<BR>
<BR>

gives Contr-A the home functionality in all this application parts.
<P>
For the filemanager and search window this is the only way the change keybindings. Inside the menu you can also change keybindings by putting 
<I>253</I>

in front of the key numbers. See  firstmenuitem.
<BR>

What follows are all procedures mentioned in the menu with a description and their
place in the menu. It is exactly the same information as you get when you press F1
within the menu.
<BR>

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>addfile</B>

You can press return on the name to run the procedure. 
Press F1 to get help about the procedure.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>selectdynprocedure</B>

</DL>

<BR>

Dynamic (Alt-t,d)
<P>
Listing of available dynamic procedures (procedures defined in plugins) or
faked dynamic procedures (plugins compiled in the main program).
The procedures can be bound to keys, placed in the menu or used in other
plugins. You can press return on the name to let it work. Press F1 to get 
help about a procedure.
<P>
To load a plugin in bed you should use Alt-t,l or use a plugin 
statement in bed's configuration file:
<P>
plugin PLUGINFILENAME
<P>
Where PLUGINFILENAME is the filename of a plugin (ends with .plug).
(See the PLUGINS section of bed.1).
To change the default directory used by bed for looking for plugins use:
<P>
plugindir PATH
<P>
Where PATH is a unix path (see the CONFIGURATION section of the bed manual).
<P>
Bed comes with a certain number of plugins. Some are compiled in the main
program, others are precompiled dynamic modules and some have to be 
compiled by the user. Details differ depending on the operating system.
The MS windows version of bed doesn't currently support dynamic plugins, 
so to be used a plugin should be compiled in the main program and
not all plugins (that work under MS windows) are compiled in by default.
<P>
Plugins supplied with bed reside in the plugins/examples directory of
bed support files. To compile all plugins copy the whole bed directory 
tree to a place were you have write access, goto plugins/examples and
press make. Depending on you gcc installation you have sometimes to
use a home compiled bed before you can load a plugin you have 
compiled yourself.
<P>
A description of the plugins is given in plugins/examples/README.
<P>
The same descriptions you can get in this procedure listing by pressing F1. 
You can can also find it in the Procedures subsection of the 
CONFIGURATION section of the manual page.

</DL>

<BR>

Replace (Alt-e,e)
<P>
Regular expression: 
Use the GNU regular expression library to match a pattern 
against the text (See man <A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+regex">regex</A>(7)). 
In normal search the search string is first converted to bytes
and then matched with the raw file content. With regex search the
file content is first converted to the datatype before regex
search. Sometimes different bytes have the same appearance in a 
datatype. In that case you should always search with regex
checked, examples: Float, char2 and when filters like duplicate
or skip are applied.
Case sensitive: 
When checked upper and lower case are treated distinctively.
Boundaries: 
Multibyte datatypes can be aligned differently. For example a 4
byte digit can start at offset 0,1,2 or 3 and that will give
different 4 byte digits. Without checking Boundaries all will
be returned. With Boundaries checked only bytes aligned in the
same way as is now shown on the screen are returned.
Forward: 
When checked the file is searched in the forward
direction going from lower to higher offsets. When not checked 
the file is searched backward.
Edge file: 
When checked the file is searched from the edge of
the file. From offset 0 when searching forward, from end of
file when searching backward.
Find: Here you type the search pattern
Replace:
At the place where the search string is found the 
replacestring is placed. The replace string overwrites the data. 
When Regular expression is checked you can insert the whole search 
string by &amp; or supexpressions by \1 \2 to \9. In the searchstring
subexpressions are demarcated by \(pattern\).
List: 
Generates a list of all hits. When compiled with
CONFIG_THREADS=y you can go on editing while hits are marked
so you can view them in marklist (Alt-k,l).
Ascii, Digit etc are when checked the current active datatype.
Base:
Base of digit. E.g 16 for heximal. 
Nr bytes: 
Gives the number of bytes each data item occupies. By
some datatypes you can change this for example by unsigned integers. 
Reverse:
Reverse bytes while transforming from datatype to bytes.
Set: 
After changing datatype info (base,bytes,type) you press Return
on Set to make this the search datatype.
Convert: 
the same as Set in addition the current search string is converted.
Ok: search
Cancel: Cancel

<P>
It is not possible to use normal search in the float datatype,
you need to use regex search. Normal search translates
the search string from the datatype format back to raw bytes and
searches for these raw bytes. This is not possible because float as
displayed has not a perfect precision so that that the float
that is displayed can correspondent to more then one raw byte array.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>addBitFlags</B>

</DL>

<BR>

BitFlags (Alt-d,b)
<P>
Create bitflags. Give every bit a label which is shown if that bit
has value 1. 
Not char:
If that bit is zero, the value of Not char is shown.
Add:
Bit-label correspondences are assigned by typing a bit number after 
Bit and the corresponding label after Label and pressing return on 
Add. Bits are numbered from 0 to (8*bytenr-1). With the lowest bit 
having number 0.
This creates a list of bit-label correspondences under Flags.
Flags:
You can edit one such correspondence by pressing Alt-f followed by
selecting the correspondence and pressing return. You change the
Bit and label values and again press Return at Add.
Del:
If you press on delete the selected correspondence is deleted.
Between:
What to write between bytes. Default: nothing.
Order:
When editing a file in bitflags every item is shown as some flags.
If you want to set a certain flag you write the label. If order is
set this is only possible if you are above the position of this
label. If order is not set you can set the label at every position.
Example:
If the flags are zyx and order is set you can change --- in --x only
by pressing x at position 0, without order you can press x
also at position 1 or 2.

a normal composed datatype. You just add the other fields. 
You change the number of bits of a certain field by setting the cursor 
on that field and selecting again Alt-d,e but now you press 'Change Bits'.
Another way is to make the bitfield the active datatype by pressing Alt-y,t
(Parent) and then selecting Config (Alt-y,g).

After selecting 'New' or 'Change':
Type:
The To datatype is what is shown on the screen (usually Ascii).
For certain values of the 'From' datatype you specify what should be 
shown in the To datatype.
Add:
After specifiying the To and From datatypes, you specify the From 
and To values and press Add. 
Default:
If there is no assignment Default is shown.
Assignments:
After pressing Alt-g you can select a certain existing assignment.
Pressing Return makes it editable, pressing Del deletes it.

<B>reorderunit</B>

</DL>

<BR>

Reorder (Alt-y,o)
<P>
One of the filters that is transforms the data when read from the file and
before interpreted by the datatype.
Reorders bytes within item. Unit gives the number of bytes to keep together.
If the bytes are 'abcdef', reorder with unit=1 gives 'fedcba', with unit=2 
gives 'efcdab', with unit=3 gives 'defabc'.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>duplicate</B>

</DL>

<BR>

Duplicate (Alt-y,i)
<P>
Useful if you like to use the same data more than once in a composed
datatype. It acts like an union in c. 
Filter that duplicates bytes before being interpret by the active (sub-)
datatype. You have to specify how many times it is duplicated (dubnr).
The active (sub) datatype consists of a certain number of bytes (size).
usenr=(size/dubnr) gives the number of bytes used for every item.
dubnr times the same usenr bytes are appended and given to the datatype.
Example:
You use ascii/4 (ascii consisting of 4 bytes). You say duplicate 2 
and the file consists of abcdefghijkl.
Before applying the filter this was displayed as abcd efgh ijkl.
After applying the duplicate filter it becomes abab cdcd efef ghghe ijij klkl.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>addskip</B>

</DL>

<BR>

Skip (Alt-y,k)
<P>
Filter to skips a certain number of bytes.
You have to specify after how many bytes and how many bytes are to be
skipped. This is then repeatedly applied to every unit of the active (sub-)
datatype.
Example:
The active datatype is ascii/4. The file contains 'abcdefghijkl'. 
abcd efgh ijkl is displayed. 
Applying Skip with After=2 and Skip=1 gives: abde ghjk.
After ab c is skipped after de f is skipped and after jk l is skipped.
It is not possible to use normal search in a datatype were Skip is
applied. You need to use regex search. Normal search translates
the search string from the datatype format back to raw bytes and
searches for that string. This is not possible when Skip is applied
because one search string can correspondent to more then one
raw content bytes string.

Take notice of the fact that RAW keystrokes are saved. This means that
the recorded keystrokes are very unportable. They are not portable between
operating systems but also not portable between terminals and configurations.
What's is recorded within xterm does not necessarily work with rxvt or
with linux console. You can use more portable keystrokes by using
only Alt-char and Control-char keys. The movement and function keys are
very unportable and also combinations of Alt or Control that make use of

Besides the procedure is shown what you need to write in the
configuration file to declare this key-procedure binding.
<P>
Examples 
After Alt-t,k, you press F12 and get
keys 27 91 50 52 126 = makeselection
<P>
The procedure is makeselection which is bounded to escape 
sequence: 27 91 50 52 126
If you like to bind makeselection to an other key sequence, you
press after Alt-t,k the key sequence you want to bind it to. 
You could for example press C-a get 1 as answer and replace '27 91 50 52 126' 
in the previous keys statement with 1.
So you could add keys 1 = makeselection to the end of ~/.bedrc
<P>
To know a procedure bounded to the menu, you press the key sequence needed

<P>
Procedure quit is bounded to a menuitem. The menu item is in menu 0
(the first menu) has label 'E~xit' and had keylabel 'M-x' and is the
twelves menuitem in the menu (starting with 0 and counting empty places).
<P>
If you like to change to name from 'E~xit' to '~Quit' you can add
menuitem 0 &quot;~Quit&quot; &quot;M-x&quot; 12 = quit

Sub (Alt-y,u)
<P>
With this function you can create a composed datatype within another
composed datatype. First make a element of a composed datatype
the active datatype and then use this function (Alt-y,u)
to make a sub composed datatype around the active datatype.
After this you can add more datatypes to this sub composed datatype, 
by using the &quot;Add field&quot; option while starting a new datatype or 
by using Alt-y,r. New datatypes created with add field
are always added to the lowest composed datatype in which the active
datatype is contained. The message line shows what datatype is active.
Use Alt-y,t and Alt-y,c to change to the datatype
this datatype is contained in and back again. You can also make the
composed datatype the active datatype by placing the cursor between
two of it's member (child) datatypes.
Subcomposed datatypes can be useful if you want to use a filter for only
a subset of the members of a composed datatype.
For example a file consists of records of three ascii strings and you
like to exchange the position of the first two strings.
After creating three ascii strings of 10 in one record (composed datatype),
you set the cursor on the first field and press Alt-y,u. This
makes a subcomposed datatype around this field. To add the second field
to this composed datatype you set the cursor at the second field and
press Alt-y,r. Now you set the cursor between the first two 
fields (or you press Alt-y,t) and you reorder with unit 10 using 
Alt-y,o.

example: {{a,b,c},d,g}
Here the letters are datatypes and {..} is one composed datatype.
{a,b,c} is a nested (or sub) composed datatype.
If you put the cursor on d and apply this function, you can add d to
this sub composed datatype. So you get then {{a,b,c,d},g}.

Select a device to edit like a large file.
When you make changes keep in mind that bed saves information in

information back.
The devices shown are taken out of /proc/partitions. Subvolumes of LVM 
partitions are not included. To edit them start bed with something like

index2table
<P>
index2table interprets the file content as long's (4 bytes)
which are indexes in a table at some offset in the current file.
Instead of the index number it displays the content of that table
at that position. index2table is a filter that should be applied
to a datatype appropriate for the data in the table. For this
purpose this procedure asks to specify at what offset in the file
the labels start, with what index the table starts and table length.
Index2table is for example used to show the names of procedures
in a symbol table. index2table is then applied to
ascii strings that shows this label instead of the index.
dynsym and symtab are sub classes of index2table.
They are used by misc/dynsym.bedda and misc/symtab.bedda.
Because of this use index2table was previously called symtable.

<H3>Introduction</H3>

Bed has the possibility to call C++ functions from within bed and to access some of the
data of bed.
<BR>

Here is an example:
<PRE>
/*Begin example1.cpp */
#ifdef GLOBAL
#endif
#ifdef EDITOR
int  example1(void) {
        message(&quot;Hello world!!!&quot;);
        }
#endif
call(example1)
/* End example1 */
</PRE>

Everything in the area in which GLOBAL is defined is code outside of the EDITOR
class. Everything inside the area in which EDITOR is defined is inside the Editor
class and at the end of the files are the names of the procedures which should be
bounded to a key in bed.
<BR>

In this example the procedure example1 uses an function of bed which writes a
message to the messageline and call(example1) says that the function example1
should be accessible by bed.
<BR>

This function example1 you can bound to a key the same way as bed's own procedures . For example
<BR>

keys 1 = example1
<BR>

to bind contr-A to example1.
<BR>

To compile the example you need just to do 
<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>make example1.plug <BR>
<BR>

in the plugings/examples directory. Which assumes that there is the original Makefile
and the make variable PLUGINDIR is assigned to the directory in which plugin.cpp,
faked.h and mainprocedures.h reside.
<BR>

Ones compiled you have to put the line
<BR>

plugin ABSOLUTEFILENAME
<BR>

in ~/.bedrc before you bind a key to the corresponding functions.
<BR>

So in for this example you can add
<BR>

plugin /usr/local/share/bed/plugins/example1.plug
<BR>

keys 1 = example1
<BR>

in ~/.bedrc to enjoy the pleasure of getting &quot;Hello world!!&quot; when you press Contr-A.
<BR>

In the procedures you write you can use all the procedures which can bounded to
keys (which have the format int name(void)), plus some extra procedures I am going to describe now.
<P>

Bed running the Fedora 10 version of Linux doesn't load plugins. 
It has something to do with NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux).
See 
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?8+selinux">selinux</A></B>(8)

<BR>

If the command 

<PRE>

        getenforce

</PRE>


returns Enforcing, your installation has this problem.
If you have root permissions you can turn it of with the command

<PRE>

        setenforce 0

</PRE>


To keep it disabled after a reboot you have to make the following changes in /etc/selinux/config:

<PRE>

        Remove:
                set SELINUX=enforcing 
        Add:
                set SELINUX=disabled 
</PRE>


<P>
For more information follow
<B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+setenforce">setenforce</A></B>(1)

<P>

You can also keep SELinux enforcing and do the following:

<PRE>

        chcon -t textrel_shlib_t *.plug

        for bedplug in  *.plug;  do semanage fcontext -a -t textrel_shlib_t $bedplug ;done

again on top.
<A NAME="lbBA">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Global</H3>

<B>extern Editor *editfile(const char *file)
<BR>

</B>
<BR>

Open a new file. When you want to do operations on this file you should hold in
mind that the previous functions are part of the class Editor. So when you can do
for example:
<PRE>
/*start stupid.cpp
#compile with make stupid.plug
#put in ~/.bedrc
plugin /usr/local/share/bed/plugins/stupid.plug
keys 1 stupid
# and call contr-A in bed

<BR>

Some examples of plugins are put in plugins/examples: one shows the assembler labels of the bytes starting with the cursor
(gdb.plug), one shows the file type (when the cursor is on the first byte of a file)
(file.plug) and and one filters what's selected through an other program (filter.plug).
<BR>

A new syntax uses class Editor {} instead of the defines. If you use the old syntax the file name should end at .cpp, when using the new syntax at .cc.
In the new syntax you should put the following statements above any code:
<PRE>
#include &quot;global.h&quot; 
BEDPLUGIN
</PRE>

Instead of #ifdef EDITOR ... #endif you write
<PRE>
class Editor {
public:
#include &quot;faked.h&quot;
int proc(void) {
        }
};
call(proc)
</PRE>

and put you procedures under #include &quot;faked.h&quot;
the call statements you place under the '}'.
<P>
<B>WARNING!!</B>
<BR>

You should NEVER define any variables within class Editor (or between #ifdef EDITOR and its #endif. You should also never try access variables of the main program (relating to class Editor) directly. With this version of gcc it is possible to distribute the procedures of a class over different files, but not it's data.
<BR>

<A NAME="lbBB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Datatypes</H3>

<P>

<B>int Editor::installpart(ScreenPart *part,int field);</B>
<P>

Installs datatype part, which means that this datatype is used to display the curent file.

<BR>

<P>
class char2 the new datatype.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

declareparent
</DL>

<P>

Is a statement what should be included in every datatype class. In combination with parentd it is used to determine the parent child relations between classes.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

char2 ( Editor *ed): ScreenPart( ed, 1 ,256, 2 )  {
</DL>

<P>

every datatype class should also contain a contructer with as first argument Editor *ed and it should call the parent constructor.
ScreenPart takes as first argument ed, as second the numbers of characters every item needs to be displayed on the screen. As third argument the base of the datatype (or something arbritary if this datatype has no base) and ad fourth argument the number of bytes of the screen this datatype uses.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

apart=0
</DL>

<P>

States that the items are zero space apart of each other on the screen. The default is 1 space between items.
int form2bin(char *formal, unsigned char *bin, int &amp;len) {      
form2bin comes from format to bin. It transforms formatted input to binary form (the raw form in the file).
formal contains the formatted input, bin is filled with its binary form. len is a reference to the length of formal and should be set to the length of formal that is actually used. form2bin should return the number of bytes placed in bin.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

int bin2formal(unsigned char *bin, char *formal, int len) {
<P>

</DL>

bin2formal transforms binary input to formatted output.
bin contains the binary input, in formal the formatted output is placed.
len contains the length of bin. It should return 0 on success and -1 on error.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;int&nbsp;isel(int&nbsp;ch)
</DL>

<P>

isel determines what character input (e.g. keyboard) input this datatype can handle. Unsigned decimal integers can handle for example 0-9 (isdigit(ch)).
It should return nonzero when it can handle the input and 0 when not.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
datatype(char2)
</DL>

<P>

The datatype statement makes the datatype known to bed, it adds this datatype to the datatype list so that it is seen with Alt-d,t and you can use it in saved datatypes. You can use ScreenPart *getchar2(Editor *ed) to get char2.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
parentd(ScreenPart,char2)
</DL>

<P>

Also a obligatory statement, stating that char2 is a child of ScreenPart.
<BR>

<P>

Other statements functions which can be defined in datatypes (ScreenPart's):
<P>

<B>int chbytes(int byt)</B>
<BR>

Changes the number of bytes the datatype uses (used by Alt-y,g).
If byt=-1 is should return a number greeter then 0 if the number of bytes can be changed. If bytes&gt;0 is should change its number of bytes to this value and return the number of bytes it occupies. On error is should return -1.
<P>

<B>int chbase(int base)</B>
<BR>

Returns the current base (ScreenPart::type) with b==-1, returns -type if b==0.
Returns -1 if base can't be set and changes to base base otherwise returning the base.
<P>

<B>char *getconvstr(void)</B>
<P>

A procedure that can be defined to return a string describing some extra 
options set in the current instance of this datatype. When saving datatypes 
this string will also be saved and when the datatype is recreated from the
saved datatype it will be given to the curresponding procedure setconvstring 
to set these options.
The string can be a static string if you like; it will not be freed by the main program.
<P>

<B>int setconvstr(char *str)</B>
<P>

Procedure that can be defined to set the options of a string this datatype
returned with getconvstr. It should return -1 on error, otherwise it should
return 0.
<P>

<B>userconfig(int modify)</B>
<P>

Procedure that can be defined to create your own dialog presented to the
user to configure the datatype
If modify=1 the datatype is already shown on the screen, as when it is called by Alt-y,g.
If modify=0 useconfig is called on creation of the datatype. In the last case usrconfig should call installpart(sub,separ) to add this datatype to the screen.
<P>

Most datatype classes would also contain a copy constructor <B>Datatype(Datatype &amp;fl)</B>
<P>

For additions and modifications you can look at the example plugins or in faked.h or the Tools menu inside bed (Key binding and Procedures).
<A NAME="lbBC">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Filters</H3>

<P>
<B>int ScreenPart::addfilter(Filter *fil)</B>
<P>

Adds Filter fil to the filters of current datatype. Returns -1 on failure.
Otherwise it returns the number of filters.
<P>

<B>int ScreenPart::rmlastfilt(char *name=NULL)</B>
<P>

Removes last filter. If name!=NULL it only removes this filter if name is the name of the the last filter. Name is for example Duplicate, Reorder, Skip etc.
<P>

Filter *ScreenPart::getlastfilter(void)
<P>

Get the last applied filter if it exist, otherwise it returns NULL.
<P>

<B>Creating filters</B>
<P>

A filter sits between the datatype and the file and transforms the data.
It is a sub class of Filter (lets call it SubFilter).
<P>

Filter contains the following variables:
<BR>

char *name; /*All references to this name should contain the same pointer. set by name=filtername(SubFilter) (without &quot;&quot;) extern char *filtername(SubFilter); should be defined above the class. */
<P>
<BR>

int bytesfile; /*Number of bytes of each unit at the file side of this filter */
<BR>

int bytesscreen; /*Number of bytes of each unit at the screen side */
<BR>

int err; /*set this if an error occured, that makes the filter unusable*/
<BR>

Screen side and file side doesn't mean that this is also the number of bytes per bytes on respectively the screen or the file. Other filters before or after can change this.
<P>

It contains the procedure fromfile which transfroms the data from the file to the datatype (ScreenPart):
<P>

<B>virtual int fromfile(unsigned char *input,int &amp;len,unsigned char *output)</B> 
<P>

Input: contains the input, len the length of the input. If less bytes are used len is set to the acually used length. output points to a array in which the output is written. The function returns the length of the output.
<P>

<B>virtual int tofile(unsigned char *input,int &amp;inplen,unsigned char *output)</B>
<P>

To file is identical except that now the direction is from the datatype to the file.
<P>

Beside these, it should contain the following procedures:
<P>

<B>SubFilter(int filebytes,int screenbytes,char *conf)</B>
<P>

Constructor with as arguments the number of bytes at the file side of the filter (filebytes), the number of bytes at the screen side of the filter (screenbytes) and a config string (conf). conf is a string returned by convstr of the same filter class and is used to save settings of the filter when saving datatypes.
<P>

<B>char *convstr(void)</B>
<P>

Procedure that returns a configuration string used to set options while recreating this filter.
<P>

<B>SubFilter(Filter &amp;rev)</B>
<P>

A copy contructor.
<P>

<B>Filter *newone(void)</B>
<P>

Returns a new copy of this filter
<P>

<B>int chbytes(int b)</B>
<P>

Changes the number of bytesfile to b. Returns -1 on failure, otherwise returns bytesscreen (after having recalculated it's value).
<P>

<B>int chbytesback(int b)</B>
<P>

Changes the number of bytesscreen to b. Returns -1 on failure, otherwise returns bytesfile (after having recalculated it's value).
<P>

<B>int  equal(Filter *fil)</B>
<P>

Returns 1 if fil is equal to this filter, 0 otherwise. 
<P>

<B>virtual int screen2filepos(int pos)</B>
<P>

Can be defined to return the byte position on the fileside given a position on the screenside.
<P>

<B>virtual int file2screenpos(int pos) </B>


<P>

The same as screen2filepos in the opposide direction.
<P>

Outside of the class you should register the filter with <B>registerfilterclass</B>(SubFilter). Needed for example to use this filter while reading saved datatypes.
<P>

Currently you should write your own procedure to add a filter to a datatype.
The most simple procedure is the following: 
<P>
<PRE>
#include &quot;global.h&quot;
#include &quot;screenpart.h&quot;
#include &quot;reverse.h&quot;
BEDPLUGIN
class Editor {
public:
#include &quot;faked.h&quot;
int addFilter(void) {
        ScreenPart *part=activemode();
        int byt=part-&gt;datbytes();
                Reverse *sub=new Reverse(byt,byt,&quot;1&quot;);
                if(sub-&gt;error()) {
                        message(&quot;cant add filter&quot;);
                        return -1;
                }
                   addfilter(sub);
        return 0;                                               
        }
};
call(addFilter)
</PRE>

You should Reverse change in the name of the Filter and &quot;1&quot; to the config string.

cygwin1.dll is included. To my knowledge this compels me to host the source: <A HREF="http://bed.dse.nl/download/cygwin-1.7.5-1-src.tar.bz2">http://bed.dse.nl/download/cygwin-1.7.5-1-src.tar.bz2</A>

<BR>

cygwin1.dll version 1.5.25-15 is included. Because of storage limitations I refer to a Dutch cygwin mirror: 
<A HREF="http://cygwin.xl-mirror.nl/release-legacy/cygwin/cygwin-1.5.25-15-src.tar.bz2">http://cygwin.xl-mirror.nl/release-legacy/cygwin/cygwin-1.5.25-15-src.tar.bz2</A> Taking the Modus tollens of Kant's &quot;Du sollst, denn du kannst&quot;.
<BR>

Using a very different version  of cygwin1.dll will give problems. Using this version of cygwin1.dll with other programs compiled with a different version of cygwin1.dll will also give problems, the same is true for using different versions of cygwin1.dll beside each other. There seems to be no other solution then constantly modifying and recompiling all programs compiled with cygwin1.dll. You can get especially funny effects when you use native Windows code to speed up some sections and leave the less crucial parts unchanged, which in a new cygwin1.dll version can result, for example, in the windows and the POSIX functions using a different current directory. So if you want to port something to Windows use another POSIX library. E-mail me if there is some way to do that without having to spend weeks collecting and installing all kind of auxiliary software.

It is compiled with the free CYGWIN version of gcc. 
See <A HREF="http://cygwin.com">http://cygwin.com</A>
<P>

To compile bed for win32 you need:
<BR>

- gcc,binutils,gnu make,grep, sed,textutils,findutils,fileutils,diffutils,which and probably some other utilities from cygwin <A HREF="http://cygwin.com">http://cygwin.com</A>
<BR>

- GNU regex (different from libregex.a from cygwin): e.g.  <A HREF="http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/regex/regex-0.12.tar.gz">http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/regex/regex-0.12.tar.gz</A>
