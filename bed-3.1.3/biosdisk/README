Thunk to 16 bit windows dll to call bios via DPMI.

biosdisk.dll: win16 dll
biosdisk32.dll: win32 dll which calls biosdisk.dll

biosdisk.dll is compiled with Borland 4.5
biosdisk32.dll with gcc

How to make this bios disk call with a win16 thunk, I have from the source
of explore2fs (see http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/).
