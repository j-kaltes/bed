Version 0.0.4, Source number  404 Sat Feb 7 05:06:59 MET 1999

- more portable member function pointers 
- '-' in name of archive
Version 0.0.3, Source number  348 Sat Jan 16 05:06:59 MET 1999
- Tracing calling of functions for debugging (because gdb version 4.16 support of c++ is 
	restricted, no stack when failing in delete )

Version 0.0.2, Source number 241 (Thu Dec 17 09:38:55 MET 1998)

- added menus to alt-f,p
- Added the possibility to see keybinding (Alt-f,k)
- By some unknown reason, when ascii took the full screen, linedown gave strange
results. Solved with an extra refresh when ENDOFLINEBUF is defined. When this
buf, in probably ncurses is solved, this should not be defined.

Version 0.0.1 Sourcenumber 205 Mon Dec 14 07:51:42 MET 1998

- getselbuf was wrong
- Bug in regex compile (searchexpr was not set properly to zero before compile). This
	resulted in a segmentation violation when using groupings.
- Jump over replaced part in regex replace;
- Processking of key bindings changed so that keys that overwrite a shorter or longer definition will not get into 
trouble.
- Alt-F in open now not changed by other operations
